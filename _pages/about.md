I'm a Ph.D. student in School of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/), Georgia Tech, specializing in Robotics. I'm advised by Dr. [Ye Zhao](https://www.me.gatech.edu/faculty/zhao) at the [Laboratory for Intelligent Decision and Autonomous Robots (LIDAR)](https://lab-idar.gatech.edu/). 

Prior to that, I received an M.S. also in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/) from Georgia Tech in 2020 and a B.Eng. in Automation from [Northeastern University (China)](http://english.neu.edu.cn/) in 2018.

My research interests center around planning, control and optimization for manipulation and legged locomotion, especially in: 

1) Computationally efficient trajectory optimization and whole-body control for highly dynamic motions; 

2) Task and motion planning for single- and multi-robot system;

3) Learning algorithms for agile locomotion.
