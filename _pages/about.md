I'm a Ph.D. student in School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, specializing in Robotics. I'm working with Dr. Ye Zhao at the Laboratory for Intelligent Decision and Autonomous Robots (LIDAR). 

Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Automation (Systems and Controls), School of Information and Science Engineering, Northeastern University, China in 2018.

My research interests center around planning, control and optimization for manipulation and legged locomotion, especially in: 

1) Computationally efficient trajectory optimization and whole-body control for highly dynamic motions; 

2) Task and motion planning for single- and multi-robot system;

3) Learning algorithms for agile locomotion.
