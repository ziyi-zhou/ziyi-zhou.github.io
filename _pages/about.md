I'm a Ph.D. student in the School of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/), Georgia Tech, specializing in Robotics. I'm advised by Dr. [Ye Zhao](https://www.me.gatech.edu/faculty/zhao) at the [Laboratory for Intelligent Decision and Autonomous Robots (LIDAR)](https://lab-idar.gatech.edu/).

Prior to that, I received an M.S. in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/) from Georgia Tech in 2020 and a B.Eng. in Automation from [Northeastern University (China)](http://english.neu.edu.cn/) in 2018.

My research interests center around optimization-based planning, control, and estimation for contact-rich manipulation and legged locomotion:

1. **Computationally efficient trajectory optimization and model predictive control**
2. **Agile locomotion leveraging whole-body dynamics**
3. **Safety-guaranteed footstep planning in challenging terrains**
4. **Reinforcement learning for contact-rich loco-manipulation**

I also collaborated closely with [SkyMul](https://www.linkedin.com/company/skymul/) to automate the rebar tying process using quadrupedal robots. Check out some of the work we showcased at WOC 2024!
